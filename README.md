# CS Prep Guide

This guide aims to help you scale from zero to infinity for a career in domains related to Computer Science in general and Software Development in particular. I'd highly encourage you to read [this](https://captnemo.in/2015/10/12/get-better-at-software-development.html) as well - as an introduction to getting better.
